## When to use this skill

Use this skill when implementing cross-component communication, event delegation, or when components need to signal state changes to parent elements.

For patterns, examples and best practices, see [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md).

For project-specific event naming conventions, refer to `.context/CLAUDE.md` or `.context/COPILOT.md`.
