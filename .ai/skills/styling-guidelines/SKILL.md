## Summary

Guidelines for writing component CSS consistent with design system principles.

## Key principles

- Component styles are scoped locally (no global class names)
- Use design tokens for spacing, colors, and sizes (rather than hardcoding)
- Use semantic HTML selectors (element and attribute selectors)
- Implement CSS layers for organization and specificity control
- Support responsive design with mobile-first approach

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when authoring component CSS to ensure design consistency, maintainability, and proper layout behavior.
