# Contributing to karaoke-tracker

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is open source and welcomes contributions of all kinds: bug fixes, enhancements, translations, documentation, and more.

Before you start, please read the following:

- Always consult `docs/RULES.md` and the guides in `docs/coding-styleguides/` before submitting changes.
- Use `pnpm` for all local operations (install, start, build, test).
- Keep changes small and focused: one PR per logical change makes reviews faster.

Contribution process

1. Open an issue if you found a bug, want to propose a feature, or aren't sure where to start.
2. Create a branch for your work from `feat/` or `fix/` (e.g. `feat/add-some-feature` or `fix/typo-readme`).
3. Implement the change following the rules in `docs/RULES.md`.
4. Add tests or perform local manual verification if applicable.
5. Open a Pull Request linking the related issue and using the PR template.

Helpful conventions

- Branch naming: `feat/description`, `fix/description`, `chore/description`, `docs/description`.
- Commit message: use a concise summary (Conventional Commits are optional but encouraged).
- Code style: follow `docs/coding-styleguides/javascript.md` and `docs/coding-styleguides/css.md`.

Pull Request checklist (please review before opening a PR):

- [ ] Code follows the guidelines in `docs/`.
- [ ] I have manually tested the changes (describe how in "How to test").
- [ ] I did not add unnecessary dependencies.
- [ ] I updated documentation if necessary.

Review and merge

- PRs will be reviewed by the maintainers.
- You may be asked to update the PR based on feedback.
- After approval, maintainers will merge following the project's merge strategy.

Thank you for contributing — every bit of help is appreciated!
